# BandMixer

BandMixer is a platform used to connect musicians, offering a solution they can use to create a band, join an existing one, or find other musicians to jam with.

The contributors of this group project include:
* Myself
* Aidan Webster (github.com/aweb0505)
* Timothy Schommer
* Andrew Sandor

To build out this app, we used React, Bootstrap, Spring Boot, and MySQL.

When everything was said and done, our team won best project, and 3 out of the 4 members on the team won best coder awards (including myself).

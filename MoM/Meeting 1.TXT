Talked generally about possible features:
	Ex- Distance based search (so if don't want to drive too far to meet your band mates)

Discussed issues we had with getting project approval. TA said he would contact Mitra about
meeting with us for approval.

Made sure we were all on the same page about meeting times.

Made a backup plan if we were not able to get approved to use React.js
	- We will switch to Android studio if we can't get approval

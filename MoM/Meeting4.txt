3 Discussed current proggres on project. Ability for both ends to connect and talk to each other. Profile page and
advanced search page have been set up.
Results page has been created plus register and sign in now works. User profile and edit profile pages were 
connected. Work was done on postmates to get the register function to add new users along with the ability to
delete them.
4 Have profiles set up on backend so that it can work together with the frontend. Create a working search function
and have users stay signed in after refresh. Move the user profiles to their own screen.
